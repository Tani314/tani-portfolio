                I am a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Brooklyn, New York.
                I recently completed the immersive software engineering bootcamp
                at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. Currently, I
                am looking forward toÂ being part of a diverse, innovative and
                inspiring team that values creativity and social change.
